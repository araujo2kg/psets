HTMl: <link>, <script>, <meta>, <header>, <nav>, <div>, <a>, <button>,
<span>, <ul>, <li>, <main>, <h1>, <h2>, <section>, <img>, <h3>, <p>,
<footer>, <i>.

CSS: font-family, padding, margin, width, height, font-size, background-color,
text-align, color, text-shadow, display, border, text-decoration, align-items.

I used bootstrap to organize the pages, mainly using classes from the grid category,
like rows and cols, and to create the interactive navigation bar. Javascript
was used to dinamically insert the navbar and footer in all of the pages, to
highlight the user page in the navbar, dinamically changing the css properties,
to insert a dinamic google maps window on a page and to create an instagram feed style gallery.

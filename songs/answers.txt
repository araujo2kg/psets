By averaging some of the provided data such as danceability, energy, valence, etc., we can gauge the types of
songs this person listens to most frequently, utilizing the provided data and considering that these measures
range from 0.0 to 1.0:

    An average danceability of 0.71 indicates that this person enjoys songs that are relatively suitable for dancing,
based on a combination of musical elements.
    An average energy of 0.65 represents a perceptual measure of intensity and activity, slightly above average. When
combined with the danceability scores, it may suggest that this person prefers songs with some energy and danceability.
    However, when considering the valence average of 0.48, which describes the musical positivity conveyed by a track,
it may indicate that this person doesn't have a preference for either happy or sad songs, but rather enjoys songs that
are a little energetic and rhythmic.
    A close proximity aura would be a Purple one; this aura color pairs well with passionate music listeners. Purple auras
tune in to get amped up, entertained, and moving as they navigate the twists and turns of their day.
The data provided by just the top 100 songs from someone is not sufficient to accurately measure their aura,
especially in a field as broad as music, where song interpretation varies for everyone. Enjoying songs with a low
valence level, which could indicate a sad song, does not necessarily mean that the listener finds them truly sad.
    To obtain a more accurate measure of the listener, more data about the songs they listen to, and a questionnaire that
explores how they respond to these songs or types thereof, would be necessary.
